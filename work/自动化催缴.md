todo: 自动化催缴
* When pushing message, such as 8 hours after unpaid orders occurred, it might be at midnight. Such as another the third day, 72 hours later or the third natural day?
    * Skip the unfriendly time window to push message
* How frequently to retrieve the result table , recommending half an hour?
* How to handle the case where unpaid orders have been dangling for more than 15 days? == historical data, how to initialize it into the result table
* One person might have more than one unpaid orders. Furthermore, he might pay only one order of all unpaid orders
* Take which one order as push message content if more then one unpaid orders
* Unique key model: userId, tradeNo, orderStatus compose the UK, another columns: order_ts, order_type..., merge with order stream, then remove the paid orders
* Need another config table including the time window in which messages are not permitted to push
* A table records the last sent time of every user who hold unpaid orders, insert into it with the http udf or send message via requests?
* Tables: Unpaid order table, Time configuration table, Message sending record table, Last sent table, To-send table including the time message should be sent
* ETLs: A common etl to produce the to-send data every 5 minutes without caring about time window, Another ETL is responsible for sending message and updating last-sent table
* Http requests are implemented in Py
* In order to redirect to the pay web from push message, Order number should be included in messages
