COMPUTE STATISTICS
In earlier releases, you could use this clause to start or stop the collection of statistics on an index. This clause has been deprecated. Oracle Database now
automatically collects statistics during index creation and rebuild. This clause is supported for backward compatibility and will not cause errors.
