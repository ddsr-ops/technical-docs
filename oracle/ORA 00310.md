Question:  I am performing a "recover database" command in RMAN and it wants a redo log sequence that I do not possess.  When I try a RMAN "recover database until cancel" command I get the error:

ORA-00310: archived log contains sequence string; sequence string required

How do I recover from this ORA-00310 error?

Answer:  Loss of a redo log often means loss of your job, and a DBA can be justifiably be fired "for cause" for not keeping the redo required to recover the database.  You must have the required redo log file on hand.  The docs note this on the ORA-00310 error:

ORA-00310: archived log contains sequence string; sequence string required

Cause: The archived log is out of sequence, probably because it is corrupted or the wrong redo log filename was specified

Action: Specify the correct redo log file; then retry the operation.

One of the first things a DBA must do is ensure that they have the redo logs for all possible recovery scenarios.  It's a DBA best practice to make mirrored copied of the redo log.
