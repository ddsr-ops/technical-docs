Question:  What is the difference between logical standby and physical standby in Oracle Data Guard?

Answer: In  Oracle Data Guard, Oracle transfers data from the main database to a standby database, and in case of failures, Oracle will switch over to the standby database.  We have two ways to create a standby database, logical standby and physical standby:

#### Physical standby differs from logical standby:

* Physical standby schema matches exactly the source database.

* Archived redo logs and FTP'ed directly to the standby database which is always running in "recover" mode.  Upon arrival, the archived redo logs are applied directly to the standby database.

#### Logical standby is different from physical standby:

* Logical standby database does not have to match the schema structure of the source database.

* Logical standby uses LogMiner techniques to transform the archived redo logs into native DML statements (insert, update, delete).  This DML is transported and applied to the standby database.

* Logical standby tables can be open for SQL queries (read only), and all other standby tables can be open for updates.

* Logical standby database can have additional materialized views and indexes added for faster performance.

#### Installing Physical standbys offers these benefits:

* An identical physical copy of the primary database

* Disaster recovery and high availability

* High Data protection

* Reduction in primary database workload

* Performance Faster

#### Installing Logical standbys offer:

* Simultaneous use for reporting, summations and queries

* Efficient use of standby hardware resources

* Reduction in primary database workload

* Some limitations on the use of certain datatypes

The main difference between Oracle physical standby database and logical standby database lies in the way they replicate and apply changes from the primary database.

#### Physical Standby Database:

* Data Replication: Physical standby database replicates data at the block level from the primary database. It maintains an exact copy of the primary database's data files.

* Redo Apply: Changes received from the primary database are applied to the physical standby database by continuously applying redo logs (generated by the primary database) to the standby database.

* Data Consistency: Physical standby database provides high data protection and can be used for disaster recovery purposes. It ensures data consistency between the primary and standby databases.

#### Logical Standby Database:

* Data Replication: Logical standby database replicates data at the SQL level from the primary database. It maintains a logical representation of the primary database's data.

* SQL Apply: Changes received from the primary database are applied to the logical standby database by converting redo logs into SQL statements and executing them on the standby database.

* Data Flexibility: Logical standby database allows for additional operations like reporting, querying, and data transformations on the standby database while still maintaining synchronization with the primary database.

* Data Types and Structures: Logical standby database supports a broader range of data types, and it can have a different structure compared to the primary database, allowing for more flexibility in data management.

In summary, the physical standby database replicates data at the block level, ensuring data consistency, while the logical standby database replicates data at the SQL level, providing more flexibility for additional operations and data transformations. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of your environment, such as data protection, disaster recovery, and the need for additional operations on the standby database.
