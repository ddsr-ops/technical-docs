You do not need to restart the database if you change the auditing of objects. You only need to restart the database if you made a universal change, such as turning on or off all auditing or changing the destination of the audit trail operating system files.

You do not need to set AUDIT_TRAIL to enable either fine-grained auditing or SYS auditing. (SYS auditing enables you to monitor the activities of a system administrator. See Oracle Database Security Guide for more information.) For fine-grained auditing, you add and remove fine-grained auditing policies as necessary, applying them to the specific operations or objects you want to monitor. You can use the AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS parameter to enable and disable SYS auditing.
