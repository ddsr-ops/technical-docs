"Except with" is used to specify the conditions of an exception to a rule or condition, as in

> "Except with proper authorization, parking on protected property is not allowed without a permit."

> "Youths of all races unable to respond to affection except with suspicion, unable to handle any problem except with rage, children disturbed by an endless list of family and social ills."

"Except for" also deals with exceptions, although it is generally used to identify the exception.

> "Everyone had arrived except for the guest of honor."
