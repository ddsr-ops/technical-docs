To safely uninstall an SSD with data from your PC running Windows 10, follow these steps:

1.**Backup Your Data**: Before you uninstall the SSD, make sure to back up any important data that you have on the disk to
another storage medium.

2.**Close Open Files and Programs**: Ensure that no programs are running from the SSD and that no files open from the SSD are
being used.

3.**Deactivate Paging File (If Necessary)**: If your SSD has a paging file on it, you'll need to deactivate it first.

* Go to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings. 
* Under Performance, click Settings.
* Go to the Advanced tab and under Virtual memory, click Change.
* Uncheck Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.
* Select the SSD and choose No paging file, then click Set and OK.
  
4.**Turn Off BitLocker (If Enabled)**: If BitLocker drive encryption is enabled on your SSD, you'll need to decrypt the drive before you uninstall it.

* Go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> BitLocker Drive Encryption.
* Click Turn off BitLocker and follow the prompts.

5.**Use the 'Safely Remove Hardware' Feature**:

* Go to the System Tray and click on the Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media icon.
* Choose the SSD you want to uninstall and select Eject.

6.**Power Down Your PC**: Once you've successfully ejected the SSD, shut down your PC completely.

7.**Physically Uninstall the SSD**:

* Unplug your PC from the power source.
* Open the case.
* Ground yourself to prevent static electricity from damaging the components.
* Disconnect the SSD from the SATA or NVMe interface and the power supply.
* Remove the SSD from the bay or slot.

8.**Reconfigure System Settings (If Necessary)**:

* If the SSD was your primary drive or contained system files, you might need to change the boot order in BIOS/UEFI to
boot from another drive.
* If you had any software installed on the SSD, you might need to reinstall it on a different drive.

Remember to handle the SSD with care to prevent any physical damage, and ensure that the PC is completely powered off
before removing the SSD to avoid data loss or hardware damage.
